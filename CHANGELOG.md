- Removed unneeded code & fix hints given by newer Rust version

### Fixed
- `visudo` would not properly truncate a `sudoers` file

## [0.2.2] - 2024-02-02

### Changed
- Several changes to the code to improve type safety
- Improved error message when a PTY cannot be opened
- Improved portability of the PAM bindings
- su: improved parsing of su command line options
- Add path information to parse errors originating from included files

### Fixed

## [0.2.1] - 2023-09-21

### Changed
- Session records/timestamps are now stored in files with uids instead of
  usernames, fixing a security bug (CVE-2023-42456)
- `visudo` will now resolve `EDITOR` via `PATH`
- Input/output errors while writing text to the terminal no longer cause sudo to
  exit immediately
- Switched several internal API calls from libc to Rust's std library
- The `%h` escape sequence in sudoers includes directives is not supported in
  sudo-rs, this now gives a better diagnostic and no longer tries to include the
  file
- Our PAM integration was hardened against allocation failures
- An attempt was made to harden against rowhammer type attacks
- Release builds no longer include debugging symbols

### Fixed
- Fixed an invalid parsing when an escaped null byte was present in the sudoers
  file
- Replaced informal error message in `visudo` with a proper error message


## [0.2.0] - 2023-08-29

### Added
- `visudo` can set/fix file permissions using the `--perms` CLI flag
- `visudo` can set/fix the file owner using the `--owner` CLI flag
- Read `env_editor` from sudoers file for visudo
- Add basic support for `--list` in sudo

### Changed
- `visudo` now uses a random filename for the temporary file you are editing
- `su` now runs with a PTY by default
- Included files with relative paths in the sudoers file are imported relative
  from the sudoers file
- `sudo` now checks if ownership and setuid bits have been set correctly on
  its binary
- When syslog messages are too large they will be split between multiple
  messages to prevent message truncation
- We now accept a wider range of dependencies
- Our MSRV (minimum supported rust version) has been set at 1.70.0

### Fixed
- Set arg0 to the non-resolved filename when running a command, preventing
  issues with symlinks when commands rely on link filenames

### Changed
