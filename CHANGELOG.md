# Changelog

## [0.2.9] - 2025-10-3

### Added
- `SUDO_HOME` variable will now be set to the invoking user's home directory

### Changed
- `Defaults noninteractive_auth` now controls whether PAM authentication
  modules are allowed to attempt authentication when `sudo --non-interactive` is
  being used (new default: off). Previous versions had this as always-on
  to allow fully automatic authentication methods to succeed.

### Fixed
- Two bugs in managing the PTY connected to the child process that negatively
  impacted interactive usability (#1130, #1264)
- `visudo --help` showed command flags that were removed (#1239)
- Format flags in `SUDO_PROMPT` were not expanded (#1252)
- `sudo` would abort with an unhandled exception instead if an attempt was
  was made to match a "netgroup", instead of ignoring these (#1262)
- A few tokenizer errors in /etc/sudoers processing (#1273, #1274, #1283)
- Some formatting mistakes in the man pages (#1285)

## [0.2.8] - 2025-08-04

### Added
- `sudo -e`, `sudoedit` to safely edit files as another user.

### Fixed
- `NOEXEC:` could not be used to prevent all shell escapes on multi-architecture
  installations (#1229)
- `sudo --list` would not show `NOEXEC`, `SETENV` and `APPARMOR_PROFILE` (#1228)
- Skip paths not accessible by the target user during command resolution (#1234)

## [0.2.7] - 2025-07-01

### Added
- Linux kernels older than 5.9 are now supported.
- Support for `Defaults noexec`/`NOEXEC:` on Linux systems based on seccomp
  filtering to prevent shell escapes in wide range of cases. This should also
  work on programs not written in C and statically linked executables.
- Support for `passwd_timeout`
- Support for `umask` and `umask_override`
- `--preserve-env=VAR` is now supported to preserve selected environment
  variables in a more convenient way

### Changed
- sudo-rs now uses CLOEXEC to close open file descriptors in the child process
- Relative paths like `./` in `secure_path`/`PATH` are now ignored.
- `apparmor.so` is dynamically loaded by sudo itself, as-needed

### Fixed
- Usernames that start with `_` or have non-western characters were not supported
  as a valid username in /etc/sudoers (#1149)
- Other usability improvements in /etc/sudoers (#1117, #1126, #1134, #1157)

## [0.2.6] - 2025-05-06

### Added
- Support for `Defaults setenv`
- Support for the `list` pseudocommand to control `sudo -U`
- Support for switching AppArmor profiles though `Defaults apparmor_profile` and
  the `APPARMOR_PROFILE` command modifier. To enable this, build sudo-rs with
  the apparmor feature enabled.

### Changed
- Added a check against PAM modules changing the user during authentication (#1062)
- `list` pseudocommand now controls whether a password is required for `sudo -l -U`

### Fixed
- Usernames commonly used by Active Directory were not parsed correctly (#1064)
- Test compilation was broken on 32-bit systems (#1074)
- `pwfeedback` was ignored for `sudo --list` and `sudo --validate`  (#1092)
-  Compilation with musl instead of glibc on Linux was not possible (#1084)
- `sudo --list` now does more checking before reporting errors or listing the
  rights of a user, fixing two security bugs (CVE-2025-46717 and CVE-2025-46718)

## [0.2.5] - 2025-04-01

### Added
- `sudo visudo` will protect you from accidentally locking yourself out
- Support for `--prompt` and `SUDO_PROMPT` environment variable
- Support for `Defaults targetpw`
- Support for `VAR=VALUE` matching in `Defaults env_keep/env_check`
- Support for `--bell`

### Changed
- Portability: sudo-rs supports FreeBSD!
- `sudo -v` will only ask for a password if the policy requires it

### Fixed
- Manual wrongly claimed `timestamp_timeout` supported negative values (#1032)
- `timestamp_timeout` in excess of 292 billion years were not rejected (#1048)
- Usernames in /etc/sudoers can contain special characters by using double
  quotes or escaping them (#1045)

## [0.2.4] - 2025-02-25

### Added
- Support for `SETENV:` and corresponding `sudo VAR=value command` syntax
- Support for `Defaults rootpw`
- Support for `Defaults pwfeedback`
- Support for host/user/runas/command-specific `Defaults`

### Changed
- Portability: sudo-rs now has experimental support for FreeBSD!
- `pam-login` feature now controls if PAM service name 'sudo-i' is used

### Fixed
- Bug in syslog writer could cause sudo to hang (#856)
- SHELL was not canonicalized when using `sudo -s` or `sudo -i` (#962)
- RunAs_Spec was not carried over on the same /etc/sudoers line (#974)
- sudo --list did not unfold multiple-level aliases (#978)
- The man page for sudoers was missing (#943)
